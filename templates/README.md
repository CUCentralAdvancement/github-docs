# Project Title

Intro sentence on the purpose of the project.

The readme will flow from the perspective of a new developer being on-boarded to your project. 
Each project readme template should be filled in by the dev who created the project, and it 
needs to be finished before other developers should be asked to work on any project.

## Local Development Setup

The first thing another developer will want to do with your project is to install it locally, 
and this is why the local development setup is the first heading in the readme.

Prerequisites:
- You might need to install something first.
- You should list `asdf`, Homebrew, Docker, and anything else here

It is best to write a series commands that a developer can run from the command line. Putting 
everything in one `./installproject.sh` with a bunch of options is overkill so start out by 
chaining together several commands with some manual step instructions.

```bash
# The .env file is a standard matching names to Heorku config vars.
cp .env.example .env

# Change language dependencies based on .tool-versions.
asdf shell node 14.16.0
asdf shell yarn 1.22.0

# Since node is involved in most projects, use yarn to standardize
# running commands.

# Install dependencies with some package manager.
yarn deps:install

# Use yarn to start and stop Docker services.
yarn services:start
yarn services:stop

# Install a database.
yarn db:create

# Seed data.
yarn db:seed

# Run dev server.
yarn app:dev
```

As you can see, `yarn` is the standard for running commands. Rather than using different tools 
to run shell commands, standardizing on `yarn` allows us to better group commands and run 
them similarly on Heroku and locally.

...should list the command prefixes:
- deps - Things to do with package management
- services - Things to do with Docker.
- db - Things to do with data.
- app - Things to do with the application server

After you finish writing the section, clone down your repository in a fresh directory to see 
if you can follow the instructions and get a working site. Often times, there's one or two 
key instructions left out in the first draft.

## Services

The first step of the previous install instructions was to set up environmental variables 
for the services being used. Some install scripts require those variables to be present 
when ran so it's important to list out the different services a developer will need to 
connect to.

Most of the environmental variables will be listed in Heroku's admin UI, but make sure to 
mention where to find the config info.

Services:
- Something for media hosting
- Something for search
- Something for background worker/queue processing
- I think you get the point...

## Testing

Now that the developer has the project setup, server running locally, and they are connected
to any necessary services, they should run the available tests and make sure they are green.
Furthermore, some sort of CI testing should be set up to run on each pull request to the 
main branch.

...need to link to testing methods docs/repo.

## Deployment

Now that the developer has green tests and everything running, they are about ready to work
on issues in the backlog. The last step is to make sure they know how to deploy the 
application. You should include everything around hosting and deploying the app.

Things to include:
- Review app process and testing. Any caveats vs. staging and production?
- Any release scripts and how they work.
- How to monitor the deployment via addons and logs.
- Any troubleshooting tips related to current/past deployment issues.
- What is the SLA for service disruption resolution?
- Ways to run "smoke tests" after a deploy, if that makes sense.

## Additional Docs

You'll inevitably have more information to write down about all the topics above. For instance,
detailing how you use a hosted search addon can be in its own documentation article linked to
the section where you first describe the "Services" used in the project.

Place these docs in a `/docs` section of your repo.

Examples could be:
- How user roles and authorization are managed.
- The backup schedule for databases.
- How users can edit content with a UI as well as API endpoints.

## Production Checklist

Heroku has [a list of recommended steps to take](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/production-check) 
before launching an application into production. The Digital Engagement team also has a few 
recommendations to complete before launching anything into production.

Copy the checklist here and complete all items before launching the app into production on 
Heroku.

GitHub:
- [ ] Dependabot set up for timely dependency updates
- [ ] System and unit tests run on each PR before being merged into the main branch
- [ ] Code linting runs on each PR before being merged into the main branch
- [ ] Linters or scanners show no accessibility issues while using the app
- [ ] CodeQL or similar scanner for preventing sensitive info in commits
- [ ] Alerts for security issues sent to Slack alerts channel
- [ ] Readme template is completely filled in including this production checklist

Heroku's Production Environment:
- [ ] At least two dynos each for web and workers are running in production for 
  redundancy
- [ ] If database, use a production tier database
- [ ] Backup schedule and DR for databases, media assets
- [ ] App monitoring tool and alerts set up
- [ ] Log monitoring tool and alerts set up
- [ ] SLA agreed upon and written down for service uptime and maintenance
