# Webflow Usage

The Central Advancement marketing groups have just begun using Webflow for smaller marketing projects
like the Impact Report. Webflow can be a great tool for content management and untangling stakeholder groups
into simpler, easier to manage web presences.

Current Usage:
- [Impact Report 2022](https://advancement.cu.edu/impact-reports/why-not) - The 2022 Impact Report is the first
  project using Webflow for content management and design.

Potential Usage:
- CU Foundation website - The CU Foundation has requested a website before and even created a committee to discuss
  updates to their subsection of the giving.cu.edu site. However, it was impratical to make those changes unless the
  Foundation had complete control of the whole menu structure.
- Central Advancement website - The IR22 site is listed as Advancement's website and can contain information about 
  Central Advancement as well as the Impact Reports. Right now there is very little information about the current
  team available to the public.
- Giving site donation application - The Giving site is primarily seen as a payment processor and so it could be 
  modified to be solely responsible for payments vs. trying to build up the Giving site to be more. A widget can
  be created to allow users to make donation "add to cart" choices and then they are sent to the Giving site for
  payment. 

## How To Use

General documentation can be moved here, but the first docs will live in the IR22 project repo:
