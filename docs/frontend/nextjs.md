# Next.js

Next.js bills itself as "The React Framework for Production". To me, it is similar to Gatsby but
allows for more flexibility with options for server-rendering, static incremental generation, as
well as a plain static export of content.

You'll find all the Next.js files in a `/templates/nextjs/` directory:

```
.eslintrc.js
.gitignore
.prettierrc.js
cypress.json
LICENSE
next-env.d.ts
package.json
README.md
tsconfig.json
```
