# GitHub Organizational User Management

The CUCentralAdvancement GitHub organization consists of a few separate teams and between 10 and 20
team members.

## Adding/Removing Users From Teams

There are three users who have "owner" permissions and can invite people to the organization and
assign them permissions. Adding and removing team members from the org should be done as part of a
regular on-boarding/off-boarding process like the NERF process.

If you need access to the GitHub account, please contact one of the org owners.

- Alex Finnarn - Front-end Developer - alexander.finnarn@cu.edu
- Matt Rousch - Director of Digital Engagement - matt.rousch@cu.edu
- Chris Rose - Director of Central Advancement IT - chris.roseh@cu.edu

To add a user to a team, follow the GitHub documentation:
https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/adding-organization-members-to-a-team

Make sure that the newly added team members use two-factor authentication for their
accounts: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication

## Active Teams

There are really only two active types of users currently:

- **Advancement - Digital Engagement** - Manages around 14 repositories of all different kinds of
  projects. Most projects are deployed to Heroku and one deployed to Pantheon.
- **NextGen - Features Team** - Manages the `sf-cuadvancement` repo but will also add at least one
  more project. These projects are deployed to Salesforce and Heroku.

## Resource Utilization

To monitor activity and keep an eye on total plan usage, you can see an overview of all the service
usage on the main billing page:
https://github.com/organizations/CUCentralAdvancement/settings/billing

Currently, admins "Receive email notifications when usage reaches 75%, 90% and 100% thresholds."
